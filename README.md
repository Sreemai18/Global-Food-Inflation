## Overview
Welcome to the Global Food Inflation Analysis project! üåçüìà

This project dives deep into the rising global food prices, exploring the underlying causes and predicting future trends using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. By analyzing economic data from Afghanistan and Burundi spanning from 2007 to 2023, we aim to uncover patterns and provide insights that can help mitigate the impact of food inflation worldwide.
Food price inflation affects economies, cultures, and everyday lives across the globe. Understanding its drivers is crucial for developing strategies to ensure food security and economic stability. This project leverages AI and machine learning to make sense of complex data and predict future trends, offering valuable information for policymakers, businesses, and communities.

## Key Features:
Data Preprocessing & Visualization: Cleaned and visualized data to identify trends and patterns.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented and compared multiple models to predict food inflation:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized models to achieve the best performance.
Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between different economic indicators.
